# Investment Analysis

There are three main financial statements for a company:

1. [Balance sheet](balance-sheets.md)

2. Income statement

3. Cash flow statement

These statements show how money moves around a company and are linked together.

Before a company can start generating sales and profits it usually has to invest money to get started, taking money from its owners and shareholders and maybe a loan from the bank to buy land, buildings computers and stock to sell.
