# What causes stock prices to change?

[Factors that can affect stock prices](https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/invest/investment-products/stocks/factors-that-can-affect-stock-prices/)

## Company News and Performance

- news releases on earnings and profits, and future estimated earnings (optimism)

- announcement of dividends (possible reward)

- introduction of a new product, or a product recall (possible reward / concern)

- securing a new large contract (optimism)

- employee layoffs (sentiment)

- anticipated takeover or merger (possible reward)

- change of management (uncertainty)

- accounting errors or scandals (distrust)

## Industry performance

Often, stock prices of companies in the same industry move in tandem with each other, because market conditions generally affect companies in the same industry the same way. For example, oil prices rise, every airline has to pay more to transport their planes.

However, sometimes the stock price for a company can show a negative correlation to a competitor if negative news is released for the competitor and the companies are competing for the same market. For example, Ryanair issues cause an uplift in Norwegian Air.

## Investor sentiment

Investor sentiment and confidence causes the market to rise or fall, which in turn causes stock prices to rise and fall.

**bull market**: a strong stock market where stock prices are rising and investor confidence is growing. Often tied to economic recovery or an economic boom, as well as investor optimism.

**bear market**: a weak stock market where stock prices are falling and investor confidence fading. Often tied to when economies are in recession, investors are pessimistic, unemployment is high and living prices are rising.

## Economic factors

### Interest Rates

Banks will raise or lower interest rates to stabilise or stimulate an economy, which is known as monetary policy.

If interest rates increase, the cost of companies borrowing money (their debt) to expand and improve their business, also rises. It costs more for the companies to borrow money. This reduces company profits and potentially the dividends it pays its shareholders, which can cause its share price to drop.

When interest rates are higher, investments that pay interest tend to be more attractive to investors than stocks.

### Economic outlook

If the economy looks like it will grow, then stock prices may rise. Investors will buy more stocks because they think the companies will get greater profits and higher stock prices.

If the economy is uncertain or shrinking then investors may reduce their buying and start selling, causing the stock prices to come down.

### Inflation

Inflation results in higher prices to the consumers, which often slows sales and reduces company profits. Higher prices also lead to higher interest rates, as the banks will raise the interest rates to slow down inflation.

However commodities may do better with inflation, so their prices rise.

### Deflation

Falling consumer prices means lower profits for companies and decreased economic activity. Stock prices may start to go down so investors start selling their shares and move to fixed-income investments like bonds instead.

Interest rates may be lowered to try and encourage people to borrow more, with the goal being to increase spending and economic activity.

### Economic and political shocks

Shocks around the world can affect the markets, as a rise in energy costs leads to lower sales, lower profits and therefore lower stock prices. Terrorism can impact economic activity and a fall in stock price.

### Changes in economic policy

If the government changes the policies this will impact businesses, either positive or negative, which can then lead to changes in inflation and interest rates.

### Value of currency

Many companies sell products to buyers in other countries. If the currency rises, then external customers have to spend more to buy the goods, which can drive down sales. If the currency falls, then external customers can buy goods for cheaper which can increase sales.
