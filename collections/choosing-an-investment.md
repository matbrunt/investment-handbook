# Choosing an investment

Using a set of investment criteria you can filter companies in an index to look for ones more suitable to the particular investment approach you want to try.

Different types of investment can be used for different purposes.

Long term buy and hold value investments can be used as stable investments that don't need to be watched all the time, and a long period of holding will average out any swings in the price.

Short term growth investments might bring a higher return but are more risky, and will need more effort monitoring and researching changes in the market.

## Simple Rules

A simple implementation of the rules below could filter the FTSE 350 index down to 20 interesting stocks to investigate further.

**Example filters**

- 10 year normalised EBIT % change (annualised): min 5%

- 10 year ROCE average: min 15%

- Dividends per share years of payments adjusted for splits: min 10%

- Interest cover: min 5%

- 10 year average of free cash conversion: min 65%

- 10 year PE average: max 20

- Normalised EPS forecast % change: min 5%

### Invest in businesses you understand

You need to know how a company makes its money, if you can't work this out then don't invest in it, as you cannot realistically question any data on the company or market.

### How large is the company

Small businesses fail more than large companies, so are more of a risk. For value investing, established companies that have been around a long time might be safer, for example those in the FTSE 350 index.

### Is the company growing

It is usually better to choose companies that have the potential to grow over companies that are cheap but cannot grow.

Shares tend to be valued on a multiple of their profits. If the multiple is too high (a sign the share is expensive) then even if profits do grow, the share price might not as this potential has already been factored in to the price.

### How long have they been around

Dividend paymnetes to shareholders are a good measure of company health, because they need to have a certain level of profits and cash flow to be able to pay the dividends.

If a company has being paying dividends for at least 10 years they might be a safer investment over a company without as much history.

### Stay away from debt

Avoid companies with lots of debt, unless they have stable profits. 

The interest payments on loans (debt) have to be paid before any money can be paid to shareholders. The more debt, the more interest has to be paid, so if profits suddenly fall shareholders might not get anything.

Look at setting a minimum interest cover of at least 5 times.

### Look long term

Be prepared to own any shares you invest in for at least 5 years to average out the surges and retreats of the stock market. If there is a large drop you need time for the stocks to recover (assuming you have a solid company that won't be wiped out by the current poor market).

### Reinvest the dividends

Compound interest is a wonderful thing. Reinvest the dividend income to build up your investment. History has shown that reinvesting dividend income contributes to a large part of the earnings from stocks, and makes you less reliant on the market always going up.

### Invest in businesses that earn more for your money

Consider investments the same way you would look at a savings account. Look for companies that earn high rates of interest on the money invested in them (the capital employed or ROCE).

Consider companies with a ROCE of at least 15%.

### Look for both profits and cash

Companies can make a profit but have no cash, which is the lifeblood of any business as cash is used to pay bills and dividends. Companies with weak cash flow will struggle to pay their bills.

Look for companies that can turn at least 66% of their profits into cash.

### Avoid shares that are too expensive

Maybe an obvious one, but it is very easy to pay too much for the latest 'hot thing' that is over hyped, as when it fails to meet the expectations of its shareholders the price will drop.

Set a limit on how much optimism you will pay for in a share - for example, look for a PE ratio of no more than 15-20. This could be 15 times current earnings or 20 times the ten year average earnings.
