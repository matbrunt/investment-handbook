# Bonds

https://www.getsmarteraboutmoney.ca/glossary/bond/

A kind of loan you make to the government or a company. They use the money to run their operations. In turn, you get back a set amount of interest once or twice a year. If you hold bonds until the maturity date, you will get all your money back as well. If you sell early and bond prices are up, you will make money. If prices are down, you will lose money.

When you buy a bond, you’re lending your money to a company or a government (the bond issuer) for a set period of time (the term). In return, the issuer pays you interest. On the date the bond becomes due (the maturity date), the issuer is supposed to pay back the face value of the bond to you in full.

You can lose money on a bond if you sell it before the maturity date for less than you paid, or if the issuer defaults on their payments.

## Ways to make money on bonds

**Interest payments**

With most bonds, you’ll get regular interest payments while you hold the bond. Most bonds have a fixed interest rate that doesn’t change. Some have floating rates that go up or down over time. On the bond’s maturity date, you’ll get back the face value.

For example, you buy a bond with a face value of $5000. The bond pays a fixed interest rate of 4% a year. If you hold the bond until it matures:

- you get back $5000

- you get 4% in interest, or $200, a year

- your return will be about $2000 over 10 years ($200 x 10)

Floating interest bonds match the interest rate on 3 month T-bills, and pay interest quarterly. If the T-bill rate goes up, you get more interest on your bonds, but if the T-bill rate goes down, you get less interest.

**Selling a bond for more than you paid**

Generally, when interest rates go down, bond prices go up. If this happens you can make money by selling your bond before it matures by getting more than you paid for it, and you get to keep the interest you made up until the time you sell it.
