# Weighted Average

A weighted average is a mean average calculated by giving some records in the sample more influence (weight) because of an attribute of the record. Each quantity to be averaged is assigned a weight, and those weightings determine the relative importance of each quantity on the average.

Most commonly a weighted average is calculated with respect to the frequency of the values in the data set, but the weights can use any contributing attribute if importance is something other than frequency of occurrence.

## Examples of weighted averages

For example if you have purchased a series of stocks over time you will have got them for different prices for each volume. Simply adding all the prices together then dividing by the number of purchases will skew the mean, so instead you can weight each purchase by its stock price at the time.

**Price paid per share**

Investment often requires compiling a position in a stock over several years. Stock prices change daily however, so you would have to keep track of the cost of each share accumulated over the years. As an overview metric you could calculate a weighted average using the price of the stock at the time of purchase and the volume bought.

For example, say you purchase 100 shares in year 1 at $10, then 50 shares in year 2 at $40. To get the weighted average of the price paid, multiply 100 shares by $10 a share for year 1, then add the product of 50 shares by $40 a share for year 2, to get a total price paid of $3000.

Then divide the total amount paid by the total number of shares acquired over the years, to get the weighted average price paid. This would be $3000 / (100+50) = $20 a share. This average is weighted with respect to the number of shares acquired at each price, not just the absolute price.

**Funds**

A fund holds multiple securities. When the fund is up 10% on the year, that 10% is a weighted average of returns for the fund with respect to the value of each component of the fund.

**Inventory accounting**

For inventory accounting the weighted average value of inventory reflects fluctuations in commodity prices, whereas LIFO or FIFO methods would give more weight to time than value.

**Company evaluation**

When evaluating companies to determine if their shares are correctly priced, investors use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to discount a company's cash flows. WACC is weighted based on the market value of debt and equity in a company's capital structure.
