# Company outstanding shares

Outstanding shares refer to the number of shares actually issued by a company and held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company’s officers and insiders.

Outstanding shares represents all equity shares, as well as floating shares and restricted shares.

If a company has only issued equity shares then you can calculate outstanding shares by simply dividing share capital on the balance sheet by the face value of the share. Outstanding shares are shown on a company’s balance sheet under the heading “Capital Stock.”.

But if a company has also issued preference shares or other classes of shares, then you will need to go through the notes under financial statements present in annual reports to find out about outstanding shares.

The number of outstanding shares is used in calculating key metrics such as a company’s market capitalization, as well as its earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow per share (CFPS).

A company's number of outstanding shares is not static, and may fluctuate widely over time.

**Floating shares**

Floating shares are those shares that can be freely bought and sold by public investors. Their quantity may change depending on buyback offers by company as well as issuing of new shares from authorized shares from within its treasury.

**Restricted shares**

On the other hand, restricted shares are shares that require special permission from stock exchange before being transacted. For example, a company XYZ has 1000 authorized shares. If it offers 300 shares in an IPO issue (these would be floating shares), gave 150 shares to executives & retained 550 in the treasury. Here, the number of outstanding shares would be 450 shares (300 floating shares + 150 restricted shares).

## Break down of outstanding shares

Any authorized shares that are held by or sold to a corporation’s shareholders, exclusive of treasury stock which is held by the company itself, are known as the outstanding shares. In other words, the number of shares outstanding represents the amount of stock on the open market, including shares held by institutional investors and restricted shares held by insiders and company officers.

A company’s outstanding shares can fluctuate for a number of reasons. The number will increase if the company issues additional shares. Companies typically issue shares when they raise capital through an equity financing, or upon exercising employee stock options or other financial instruments. Outstanding shares will decrease if the company buys back its shares under a share repurchase program.

## Finding out the number of outstanding shares

In addition to listing outstanding shares, or capital stock, on the company’s balance sheet, publicly traded companies are obligated to report the number of issued and outstanding shares, and generally package this information within the investor relations sections of their websites, or on local stock exchange websites. In the United States, outstanding shares numbers are accessible from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) quarterly filings.

## Stock splits and share consolidation

The number of shares outstanding will double if a company undertakes a 2-for-1 stock split, or will be halved if it undertakes a 1-for-2 share consolidation. Stock splits are usually undertaken to bring the share price of a company within the buying range of retail investors; the doubling in the number of outstanding shares also improves liquidity.

Conversely, a company will generally embark on a share consolidation to bring its share price into the minimum range necessary to satisfy exchange listing requirements. While the lower number of outstanding shares may hamper liquidity, it could also deter short sellers since it will be more difficult to borrow shares for short sales.

For example, Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) announced a seven-for-one stock split in June of 2015. In an attempt to increase the affordability of its stock and, concurrently, number of investors, Netflix will increase its issuance of outstanding shares sevenfold, thus drastically reducing stock price.

Increasing the number of shares outstanding due to stock splits will account for a steady increase in a companies market capitalisation over a period, and corresponding growth in investor portfolios. However merely increasing the number of shares outstanding is no guarantee of a companies success, it still has to deliver consistent earnings growth as well.

Outstanding shares are a determinant of a stocks liquidity, but liquidity is mostly dependent on its share float. A company might have 100 million shares outstanding, but if 95 million of these are held by insiders and institutions, the share float of only 5 million actually available may constrain the stocks liquidity.

## Share repurchase

If a company considers its stock to be undervalued, it will start a repurchase program, buying back shares of its own stock to take them off the open market and reduce the number of shares outstanding. This is done in the hope it will increase the market value of the remaining shares and elevate overall Earnings Per Share ratio.

For example, Apple Inc (AAPL) has increased its earnings per share by six percentage points by decreasing outstanding shares by around 11% through repurchasing. As of July 2015, Apple’s market cap is $721.40 billion and it has 5.76 billion outstanding shares. The stock price is up nearly $49 since the buyback program was announced. In its most recent earnings statement, the company reported 32.70% year-over-year quarterly earnings growth.

## Weighted average of outstanding shares

As the number of outstanding shares is used in many key financial metric calculations such as Earnings Per Share, and because this number varies over time, the weighted average of outstanding shares is often used instead.

For example, say a company with 100,000 shares outstanding decides to perform a stock split, thus increasing the total amount of shares outstanding to 200,000. The company later reports earnings of $200,000. To calculate earnings per share for the overall inclusive time period, the formula would be as follows:

(Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock (200,000)) / Outstanding Shares (100,000-200,000)

But it remains unclear which of the two variant outstanding share values to incorporate into the equation: 100,000 or 200,000. The former would result in an EPS of $1, while the latter would result in an EPS of $2. In order to account for this inevitable variation, financial calculations can more accurately employ the weighted average of outstanding shares, which is figured as follows:

(Outstanding Shares * Reporting Period A) + (Outstanding Shares * Reporting Period B)

In the above example, if the reporting periods were each half of a year, the resulting weighted average of outstanding shares would be equal to 150,000. Thus, in revisiting the EPS calculation, $200,000 divided by the 150,000 weighted average of outstanding shares would equal $1.33 in earnings per share.
